# Hospital No-Show Appointment Analysis
Exploration and Analysis of a Sample Dataset from an Hospital whose intent is to get to to know some patterns about Patients who don't show up on their appointment dates.

## Introduction
This project was initially inspired by **Udacity** in the **Nanodegree program**. It was the first project of 3 (do watch out for the remaining 2) and was meant to put to practice **Exploratory Data Analysis** in the real sense of it. However, i took it further than there by **Analysing and Visualizing** the clean dataset in Power BI. Do check the uploaded files for the .pbix file. Please note that the full documentation can be accessed in the **investigate-a-dataset.html** file

This documentation is sectioned as follows:

* Data Visualization
* Recommendation and Conclusion


### Data Gathering
As stated above, Udacity provided me with the dataset for this projeect. However, the dataset is publicly available on kaggle.com and can be checked up on the files section of this repo. It samples little above 110,000 patients (after cleaning and invalid data removed) with primarily 12 attributes about them.
