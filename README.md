# Hospital No-Show Appointment Analysis
Exploration and Analysis of a Sample Dataset from an Hospital whose intent is to get to to know some patterns about Patients who don't show up on their appointment dates.

## Introduction
This project was initially inspired by **Udacity** in the **Nanodegree program**. It was the first project of 3 (do watch out for the remaining 2) and was meant to put to practice **Exploratory Data Analysis** in the real sense of it. However, i took it further than there by **Analysing and Visualizing** the clean dataset in Power BI. Do check the uploaded files for the .pbix file.
